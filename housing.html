        <p>Housing is a fundamental aspect of a person's well-being and quality of life, and governments play a crucial role in ensuring access to safe and affordable housing for their citizens. In India, the government has implemented various housing schemes to address the housing needs of different segments of the population.

            One of the notable initiatives is the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), which aims to provide affordable housing to all citizens by 2022. The scheme has both rural and urban components, focusing on the construction of new houses as well as the enhancement and redevelopment of existing housing infrastructure.
            
            The government's efforts also extend to promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly housing practices. Initiatives to encourage the use of eco-friendly construction materials, energy-efficient designs, and waste management systems contribute to the overall goal of creating sustainable and resilient communities.
            
            In urban areas, where rapid urbanization poses housing challenges, the government emphasizes the development of smart cities and affordable housing projects. These endeavors seek to provide not just shelter but also a conducive living environment with access to essential amenities such as water, sanitation, and electricity.
